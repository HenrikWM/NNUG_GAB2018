NNUG - Global Azure Bootcamp 2018
=================================

This is a collection of workshop assignments that were given at NNUG's Global Azure Bootcamp 2018 @ Bouvet 21st of April 2018.

## Assignments overview

Using Azure services you will create a serverless image processing pipeline with Azure Functions. The application will allow a user to upload an image and view live-updates as the image and artifacts travel through the pipeline, and become available post-processing.

During work on the assignments you will get familiar with Azure Functions and serverless architecture, Azure Storage and blob containers, and the Azure portal.

You can find out more about these services by logging into to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
